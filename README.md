# Chris's Springboard Examples
### Exercises
* JSON Example: I completed the exercises in the ipython notebook (`sliderule_dsi_json_exercise.ipynb`) itself, in the directory `data_wrangling_json`.
* XML example: similarly, I directly modified the file `sliderule_dsi_xml_exercise.ipynb` in the directory `data_wrangling_xml`.

### Project Proposals
* Education data for assessing how good is Common Core
* Health information on the incidence of diabetes
* Election 2016: Try to do a basic version of what they do at [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com)
    * What kind of primaries affected the results (open, closed, caucus)
    * How conventions have healed divisions (probably also good to examine 2008 data)
    * The meaning of convention bumps (Nate Silver's own challenge)
